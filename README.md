# TDP-BM-Tender-Discovery-Platform---Benchmarking-
Study Project Docs and Set up for government tender bids in Canada to help build a flow for competitive bidding. It includes segmentation, trends, and insights to estimate open project competitiveness.
For today's deliverable on the Tender Discovery Platform project, please complete the following tasks:

Dataset Analysis:

You will receive a dataset of closed government tender bids.

Focus on Canada only.

Take your time to extract key information that could help us build a flow for competitive bidding. Think of it as formulating ideas for providing a guesstimate for open projects.

Data Segmentation:

Divide the dataset into departments such as Maintenance, IT, Website Design, etc.

Identify and create additional categories if needed to better understand the trends.

Google Colab Notebook:

Implement your analysis and insights in a Google Colab notebook.

Ensure the notebook is set to public access and share the public link with me.

Mindset & Collaboration:

Remember, there is no right or wrongâ€”it's okay to make mistakes. Own your mistakes and learn from them.

Fail fast, learn fast: the quicker we identify and correct issues, the faster we can improve.

We are a team and collaboration is key. Together, we can build a robust approach for competitive bidding.
Key Deliverables:

 Cleaning:

Clean and preprocess the dataset for accuracy and consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identify key variables influencing successful bids.

Analyze bid distribution and pricing variations across different tenders.

Bid Price Calculation Model:

Develop a structured approach (e.g., statistical analysis, machine learning, or rule-based heuristics) to estimate a competitive bid price.

Consider factors like past winning bid amounts, project type, competition.

Process Documentation:

Outline the step-by-step approach for arriving at a bid price.

Include guidelines on how to use the model for real-time bidding decisions.

Presentation & Insights:

Summarize key findings and methodology in a brief report or presentation.

Provide recommendations on refining the process for future tenders.

Tools & Technologies:

Python/Pandas for data processing

Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-Learn (optional) for predictive modeling

Expected Outcome:

A well-documented, data-driven approach to estimating bid prices that improves the bidders ability to win government tenders efficiently
